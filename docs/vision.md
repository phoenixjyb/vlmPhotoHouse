# Vision

A private, local-first AI photo engine that unifies a decade+ of personal photos into a single organized knowledge base enabling:
- Fast semantic + structured search
- Automatic person / time / event / theme albums (no duplicate original files)
- Rich captions & tags (auto + user augmented, voice input supported)
- Scalable to 0.5–2M assets with efficient incremental ingestion
- Modular pipeline (ingest → derive → embed → index → serve) enabling iterative enhancement
- All intelligence runs locally (or on user-owned hardware) preserving privacy
