## 🏗️ System Overview

The VLM Photo Engine uses a **dual environment architecture**:

### Backend Environment (`vlmPhotoHouse/.venv`)
- FastAPI server on port 8002
- Database operations (SQLite)
- Task queue management
- Health monitoring
- API endpoints

### Voice Integration (via external service)
- Thin proxy endpoints under `/voice/*` in the backend
- Proxies to LLMyTranslate (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8001`)
- Env-configurable base URL and paths; proxy bypasses system proxies

### External Models Environment (`vlmCaptionModels/.venv`)
- AI model inference (BLIP2, Qwen2.5-VL)
- Face recognition (LVFace, MTCNN)
- 20.96 GB of local model storage
- JSON IPC communication with backend

### Key Architectural Principles
1. **Local-First**: All processing happens on user hardware
2. **Privacy-Preserving**: No data leaves the local system
3. **Modular**: Pluggable AI model providers
4. **Scalable**: From development to production deployment
5. **Fast**: Sub-500ms search performance target

## 🧩 Provider Architecture

The system uses a **pluggable provider pattern** for AI models:

- **Caption Providers**: BLIP2 (production), Qwen2.5-VL (development)
- **Face Providers**: LVFace, MTCNN, Facenet, InsightFace
- **Health Monitoring**: Each provider has dedicated health endpoints
- **JSON IPC**: Subprocess communication for external model integration
