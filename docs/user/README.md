### Key Benefits

## üöÄ Quick Start for Users

### Basic Usage

The system automatically scans your photo directories and begins processing:
- Extracts metadata (date, location, camera info)

Once processing is complete, you can search your photos in several ways:

## üì∏ Photo Organization

### Automatic Organization

- **Themes**: Categories like landscapes, food, pets, sports
- **Time Periods**: Monthly, yearly, and seasonal collections

**Manual Organization**
You can also create custom albums and tag photos manually for better organization.

### Search Capabilities

Instead of remembering exact filenames or dates, search using natural descriptions:
- "that photo of mom and dad at the restaurant"
- "pictures from our hiking trip"
- "sunset photos from vacation"
- "family dinner photos"

The AI system automatically:
1. **Detects faces** in your photos
2. **Groups similar faces** together as the same person
3. **Creates person albums** for easy browsing
