## üìà Evolution Summary

### Major Changes Since Legacy Versions

**Architecture Evolution**
- **v1**: Single environment, monolithic design
- **v2**: Dual environment architecture (backend + external AI models)
- **Current**: Pluggable provider pattern with health monitoring

**Requirements Evolution**
- **v1**: Basic photo indexing and search
- **v2**: Production-ready AI integration with local model storage
- **Current**: Privacy-first, local-only processing with comprehensive feature set

**Operations Evolution**
- **v1**: Development-only setup
- **v2**: Docker-based deployment with monitoring
- **Current**: Production-ready operations with comprehensive tooling

### Key Lessons Learned
1. **Dual Environment Architecture**: Critical for maintainability and performance
2. **Local Model Storage**: Essential for privacy and offline operation
3. **Provider Pattern**: Enables easy AI model upgrades and experimentation
4. **Health Monitoring**: Crucial for production reliability
