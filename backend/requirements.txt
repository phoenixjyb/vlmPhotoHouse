# Optional heavy ML dependencies are moved to requirements-ml.txt
# Install them only when needed (e.g., GPU/WSL2 profile) to keep mac dev fast.

# Default install: core dependencies
-r requirements-core.txt

# For production deployment with exact versions:
# Use requirements-lock-updated.txt instead
